              <b>History:</b> 157th operating temple. The Tucson Arizona Temple was originally designed with a 95-foot
              steeple, which would
              have
              required a special permit. However, plans were altered, and the steeple was replaced with a dome-shaped
              cupola—reminiscent of the famous dome that crowns Italy's Florence Cathedral—which does comply with Pima
              County planning and zoning regulations. The site for the Tucson Arizona Temple is located in the
              Catalina
              Foothills where East Ina Road curves into Skyline Drive. Cactus plants at the Tucson Arizona Temple site
              were transplanted to an on-site nursery and reintegrated into the final landscaping.

            <b>History:</b> 117th operating temple. The Accra Ghana Temple was the second temple built in Africa,
            following the Johannesburg South Africa Temple (1985), and the first built in West Africa (and in Ghana).
            The first Missionary Training
            Center in Africa opened in Tema, Ghana (just east of Accra) in 2002. The tradition of holding a youth
            cultural celebration before the dedication of a temple began with the dedication of the Accra Ghana Temple
            at the request of President Gordon B. Hinckley. The announcement of the
            Accra Ghana Temple by President Gordon B. Hinckley came after he had challenged members to make a special
            effort to fellowship new converts to the Church. "Put your arms around them, make them feel at home. Teach
            them the doctrines of the kingdom. Befriend them and help them in every way possible," he said. "I make you
            a promise that if you will do that you will be blessed with a temple in your midst." The day of the
            announcement, at an outdoor gathering of some assembled members in Accra's Independence Square, President
            Hinckley said, "You've gone a long time without a temple. When I was here five years ago
            [as a member of the First Presidency], we tried to find a place to build a temple. We didn't find anything
            and we didn't say anything to anybody. But efforts Monday, February 16, were more fruitful. This morning we
            approved the purchase of a beautiful piece of ground," President Hinckley announced.

            <b>History:</b> 14th operating temple. On November 18, 2002, an angel Moroni statue was added to the Ogden
            Utah Temple, 30 years after its dedication, as part of an exterior renovation project. The spire—originally
            colored gold—was painted a brilliant white to lend distinction to the statue. The Ogden Utah Temple was
            rededicated in 2014 after a three-and-a-half-year renovation project that architecturally transformed its
            exterior appearance. While much of the interior layout remained the same, some rooms were reconfigured, and
            all of the auxiliary systems and interior design were replaced. The adjacent tabernacle was also refurbished
            and altered including the removal of its spire, lending more prominence to the temple. All landscaping was
            redone, featuring two beautiful water features on the east and west sides of the temple. The above-ground
            parking structure was replaced with surface and underground parking.

            <b>History:</b> 150th operating temple. After standing unharmed for 125 years, the Provo Tabernacle met
            tragedy on December 17, 2010, when a four-alarm fire, reported at 2:43 a.m., engulfed the building—ripping
            through wooden pews, organ pipes, a rented Fazioli piano, priceless pioneer craftsmanship, and original
            pieces of art. For hours, a crew of approximately 25 firefighters subdued flames and doused the building
            with water. Around 5:00 a.m., the roof began to collapse, giving way completely within the hour and dragging
            with it portions of the front parapet and wall. Crews were still drenching hot spots by mid-afternoon, but
            felt encouraged by the still-standing exterior walls. Tearful crowds gathered throughout the day, looking on
            in reverent dismay as black smoke billowed from the iconic edifice. Perhaps the most remarkable discovery
            made among the ashes the day after the fire was a giclee print of The Second Coming by Harry Anderson, which
            depicts Jesus Christ coming through the clouds with heralding angels on either side—a picture frequently
            featured in LDS temples. The tabernacle painting, which sat inside the east front door, was completely
            blackened by residual fire except for the untouched figure of Jesus Christ himself with hands outstretched.
            Those who saw the painting in person were awestruck. Officials directed the print to be removed immediately
            for conservation and stabilization. It was handled with the greatest care, wrapped in plastic, and loaded
            into a waiting truck. The extraordinary occurrence was dubbed by some to be a "Christmas miracle."
